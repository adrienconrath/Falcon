There are no variables, the file only\r\n  contains the dependency graph of the project, with a list of rules that take\r\n  several inputs to build several outputs. We consider that it is not Falcon's\r\n  job to provide a powerful way to define the dependency graph. We expect this\r\n  file to be generated by other tools such as CMake.\r\n* Falcon is a daemon that uses watchman to be notified of changes that occur on\r\n  the files that belong to the project. The configuration file is only loaded\r\n  once on startup and each time it changes. This makes incremental builds faster\r\n  because at the time you trigger a build, falcon already has the graph in\r\n  memory and knows what to do.\r\n* Falcon aims at being consistent and correct. For example, if you change the\r\n  configuration file, Falcon should remove any stale target.\r\n* Falcon will provide a caching mechanism so that you don't need to re-build\r\n  something you already built 5 minutes ago when you are switching branches.\r\n* Falcon will be Distributed. If you are working on a very large project with\r\n  hundreds of thousands of files, you will be able to build changes that you\r\n  pull very quickly. Falcon will be able to retrieve already built targets by\r\n  querying the cache of another Falcon daemon running in a continuous build\r\n  server. Why build something that someone already built for you?\r\n\r\n## Current state\r\n\r\nRight now falcon is in a working state, ie it is able to use watchman to be\r\nnotified of file changes and build your project. However, it is currently not\r\nable to reload the configuration file when it changes. The local and distributed\r\ncaching has not been implemented yet.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
