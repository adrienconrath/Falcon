<p>A Fast, Reliable, Distributed Build System.</p>

<h2>
<a name="purpose" class="anchor" href="#purpose"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose</h2>

<p>Falcon is a build system with a focus on speed and scalability.</p>

<h2>
<a name="concepts" class="anchor" href="#concepts"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Concepts</h2>

<ul>
<li>The configuration file - the "makefile" - is designed to be human-readable but
not convenient to write by hand. There are no variables, the file only
contains the dependency graph of the project, with a list of rules that take
several inputs to build several outputs. We consider that it is not Falcon's
job to provide a powerful way to define the dependency graph. We expect this
file to be generated by other tools such as CMake.</li>
<li>Falcon is a daemon that uses watchman to be notified of changes that occur on
the files that belong to the project. The configuration file is only loaded
once on startup and each time it changes. This makes incremental builds faster
because at the time you trigger a build, falcon already has the graph in
memory and knows what to do.</li>
<li>Falcon aims at being consistent and correct. For example, if you change the
configuration file, Falcon should remove any stale target.</li>
<li>Falcon will provide a caching mechanism so that you don't need to re-build
something you already built 5 minutes ago when you are switching branches.</li>
<li>Falcon will be Distributed. If you are working on a very large project with
hundreds of thousands of files, you will be able to build changes that you
pull very quickly. Falcon will be able to retrieve already built targets by
querying the cache of another Falcon daemon running in a continuous build
server. Why build something that someone already built for you?</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="current-state" class="anchor" href="#current-state"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current state</h2>

<p>Right now falcon is in a working state, ie it is able to use watchman to be
notified of file changes and build your project. However, it is currently not
able to reload the configuration file when it changes. The local and distributed
caching has not been implemented yet.</p>
